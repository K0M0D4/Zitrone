// stuff to polish:

✓ moving and resizing workspace only when window is focused
✓ moving workspace on resized window without offset
✓ add boundaries check with mouse position while moving viewport
[maybe] buttons working on sort of events instead of just isMouseClicked
    rounded rectangles for buttons / make imgui ui instead
try to inherit custom graphic classes from sf::Drawable
    and maybe some from sf::Transformable

bugfix: resizing window on scale != 1 removes scale, but multiplier
    on moving viewport stays

[maybe] move to sfml 3.0

for performance, store temp buttons as class members, and only 
    change thier values, so they aren't created every time app
    creates button
