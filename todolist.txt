// stuff to polish:

✓ moving and resizing workspace only when window is focused
✓ moving workspace on resized window without offset
rounded rectangles for buttons / make imgui ui instead
try to inherit custom graphic classes from sf::Drawable
    and maybe some from sf::Transformable
✓ add boundaries check with mouse position while moving viewport

fix bug when resizing window on scale != 1 removes scale, but multiplier
    on moving viewport stays

move to sfml 3.0

for performance, store temp buttons as class members, and only 
    change thier values, so they aren't created every time app
    creates button
